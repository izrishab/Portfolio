      <p>The Hult Prize is a prestigious global competition that brings together the brightest minds to tackle pressing social issues through innovative business solutions. Being part of this initiative at Amrit Science Campus in 2024 was an incredible journey that not only honed my marketing skills but also enriched my leadership and teamwork abilities. As the Marketing Coordinator, I had the privilege of leading our promotional efforts and ensuring our event reached a wide and diverse audience.<br><br>
As the Marketing Coordinator for the Hult Prize at Amrit Science Campus 2024, my role involved crafting and executing a comprehensive marketing strategy to boost event visibility and engagement. Faced with limited resources and a need to captivate a diverse audience, I spearheaded digital campaigns, utilized social media platforms, and organized campus-wide promotional activities. Despite challenges such as securing a suitable venue and generating student interest amid their academic responsibilities, the final event, held on February 25, 2024, at the Auditorium Hall of the Central Department of Education within Tribhuvan University Central Campus, was a resounding success. This experience allowed me to refine my marketing skills, collaborate with a dynamic team, and contribute to a global initiative aimed at solving critical social issues.</p>
